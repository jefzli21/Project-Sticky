## Difficulties
* Learning new technical skills like Express.js, MongoDB.
* Lacking communication between team members. In the early stage of the project, it often appears to do duplicate things. 
* Learning how to improve the quality of communcaiton and rationalize each person's work.
* Managing git workflow to maintain smooth teamwork. Often run into conflicts that will take large amount of time to debug
